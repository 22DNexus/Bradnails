Extra notes for software, in case you might need them.

### Cuphead
- The game automatically sets itself to a high resolution, so you will want to change it to a lower resolution to avoid lag. To do this, go to settings>visuals and change resolution. The menu for changing resolution should look like this.

### RETROARCH
- To load a game, load the core that corresponds to the system the game was originally on, then click File>LoadContent on the top left, and select your game file
- PlayStation emulation requires a PlayStation BIOS. You may have to configure this
- If you are not getting any sound output, in RetroArch go to settings>audio>output and change the output to dsound
- You're likely going to have to remap your controls for 3D games, so we recommend just sticking to 2D and using the other emulators we've uploaded for 3d games.

### DOLPHIN

### 7ZIP
- 7Zip is a software that can zip up folders into an alternative zip file. Instead of the .zip extension it compresses to a .7z file. Although, both work we will sometimes use .7z files and you unzip these by first downloading 7zip from [this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1by7I72v0vP8VvdlOQaE5SnwC3zSoam6z/view?usp=sharing). After that you can double click on the .7z and you will be greeted with this. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96384765/146795867-1458bf41-95d1-4338-8c91-3e70ca6b2eb7.png)
- Once you see that, click extract then choose a destination. The destination is where the unpacked files will be deposited. After unpacking you will have a file folder.
